ROBOTICALLY OBNOXIOUS SERVING ASSISTANT

An emotional smart assistant that doesn't listen to you

## Installation

### Windows

Download the `ROSA-installer_gui.exe` file from the `/bin` dir at [GitHub](https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA/blob/77d66ff33b5d0245961129bde095487b5cb1216e/bin)

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- [`ROSA-installer_gui.exe` file](https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA/blob/77d66ff33b5d0245961129bde095487b5cb1216e/bin)

### Setup

- Download the `ROSA-installer_gui.exe` file

- If you are on a Raspberry Pi that has LEDs connected to the GPIO header/breadboard/etc, you can write the pin numbers in the `gpio.json` file to let ROSA use the LEDs and buttons connected to the GPIO pins for operation without a monitor [See the file for more info](https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA/blob/77d66ff33b5d0245961129bde095487b5cb1216e/gpio.json)
- Please make sure you have connected your mic and speakers
- Your internet connection is stable (used to transcribe speech via Google Speech Recognition)

Then you should be able to run ROSA from the start menu/desktop if you added the locations when installing
