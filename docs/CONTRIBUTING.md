# Contributing

Looking to contribute something to ROSA? Here's how you can help:

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

- Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others
- Please make sure to provide **accurate, up to date information** on your issue/topic
  - It should include the information listed in the [issue templates](https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

- **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported
- **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `main` branch in the repository
- **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally on a fresh install
  - Either fully uninstall/reinstall the program, install inside a fresh VM/sandbox/machine
- **Give us your test environment** &mdash; Operating system name and version, program version...

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to **you** to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible

## Pull requests

Good pull requests &mdash; patches, improvements, new features &mdash; are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project

First of all, all pull request should be done on the `main` branch

ROSA uses PEP8 compatible code, so please read through the [PEP guidelines](https://peps.python.org/)

Similarly, when contributing to ROSA's documentation, you should edit the documentation source files in [the `/docs` directory of the `main` branch](https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA/tree/main/docs)

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

- [Fork](https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone locally
- Do some code, adhering to the formatting of the other files
- [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description against the `main` branch
- Reference the issues addressed in your PR

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work under the terms of the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) (if it includes code changes)
