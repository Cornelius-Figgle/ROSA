# TODO

## Problems

- run on rpi???

- threaded response+playback (locks or smth to cancel any currently running threads)

- sped?

- &#62; dynamically aud resp loading/layouts

  - error checking in loads from aud&text (filling in gaps/warnings??)

  - glob data as fallbacks (see comment ab future cfgs/flags)

- fix the cancelling in loaders/etc (CTRL+C / sys stops?? (daemons...maybe.))

## Future

- flags for bits and pieces (argparse)

- more lines (ev)

- cfg/flags for loading diff resp files/audio lists

- PyPI pkgs??? (poetry!)

- prog bars etc for build src
