# TODO

## Problems

- run on rpi???
  - kill me
- gh-pages title bar in mobile is wrong colours
  - need to redo a lot of it tbh

## Future

- flags for bits and pieces (argparse)
- more lines (ev)

- cfg/flags
  - diff audio files / text dbs
  - silent mode?
  - mic to use
  - force `is_on_RPi` state
  - gpio pins

  - &#62;dynamic aud resp loading/layouts
    - error checking in loads from aud&text (filling in gaps/warnings??)
    - global data as fallbacks (see comment ab future cfgs/flags)
  
  - move `gpio.json` to a global cfg

- PyPI pkgs??? (poetry!)

- threaded response+playback (locks or smth to cancel any currently running threads)
  - hm maybe not for now
