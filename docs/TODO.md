# TODO: ROSA

## Main Program

- Split `main.py` to `ROSA.py` & `main.py`, for classes and click-to-run respectively
- Add threaded **processing->playback** so cancel cmds etc can be recognised
  - would need to end first thread before second starts playback
  - proc can be duped maybe?
- reg *nix bin for `dpkg`/`apt`
  - [tutorial here](https://earthly.dev/blog/creating-and-hosting-your-own-deb-packages-and-apt-repo/)
