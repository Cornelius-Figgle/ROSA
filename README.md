# ROSA

ROBOTICALLY OBNOXIOUS SERVING ASSISTANT

An emotional smart assistant that doesn't listen to you

## Installation

You can either clone the repo or download the zip from Github

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA.git
```

And the dependencies can be installed via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

```shell
pip install playsound PyAudio SpeechRecognition 
```

It is recommended that these are installed inside a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in your project repo

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) will also need to be installed if it isn't already

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- [ROSA source code](https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA) from GitHub
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= v3.10

- [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/) >= v0.2.12
- [playsound](https://pypi.org/project/playsound/) >= v1.3.0
