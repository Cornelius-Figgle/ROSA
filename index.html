    <section class="main-content">
      <p>ROSA <em>(or Robotically Obnoxious Serving Assistant)</em>, is a smart assistant <em>(like the Amazon Alexa)</em>, except that it doesn't listen to you</p>

      <p>The initial idea was created by <a href="https://github.com/TheLordJesusHimself">Callum</a>, the code and development was done by <a href="https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle">Max</a>. Vocals were performed and recorded by Evie</p>

      <p>The main code is written primarily for Windows 10 and RaspbianOS, however should function on most, if not all, operating systems and platforms</p>

      <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA/blob/main/README.md">main documentation</a> for further support</p>
