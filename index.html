    <section class="main-content">
      <p>ROSA <em>(or Robotically Obnoxious Serving Assistant)</em>, is a smart assistant <em>(like the Amazon Alexa)</em>, except that it doesn't listen to you</p>

      <p>The initial idea was created by <a href="https://github.com/TheLordJesusHimself">Callum Blumfield</a>, the code and development was done by <a href="https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle">Max Harrison</a>. Vocals were performed and recorded by Evie Peacock</p>

      <p>The main code is written primarily for Windows 10 and RaspbianOS, however should function on most, if not all, operating systems and platforms</p>

      <p>Please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA/blob/main/README.md">main documentation</a> for further support</p>
    
      <h1>
      <a id="About" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="false"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h1>

      <p>ROSA is a smart assistant created in order to be annoying. That's it. Not much else tbh. She may be a bit useless, but will always be a barrel of sarcasm</p>

      <p>The ROBOTICALLY OBNOXIOUS SERVING ASSISTANT is the result of many months of hard labour <em>(translate: many months of debugging the installer)</em> and enthusiasm <em>(translate: laughter on the rare occasions it works, frustration at all other times)</em></p>

      <p>Hope you all enjoy it, have fun, and send any issues, bug reports or feature suggestions to me, ideally via the <a href="https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA/issues">GitHub issue system</a>, or via <a href="MAILTO:max:fullimage.net">email</a> if you have issues with the issue logger</p>

      <h2>
      <a id="Installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="false"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h1>

      <p>ROSA can be installed either from source or from a GUI installer (installer is Windows only). Links to both and <a href="https://github.com/Cornelius-Figgle/ROSA/blob/main/docs/INSTALLATION.md">more detailed guides</a> can be found at the top of this page</p>
